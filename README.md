# CanvaBoy

A boy who lives in the dock and gently reminds you that you have incoming reviews. He stays happy when you do your reviews on time (and gets a little grumpy if you don't).

You can right click on CanvaBoy to see a list of all your incoming PR reviews.

Your objective: Keep him happy. :)

### Installation

1. Download the app from [the releases tab](https://github.com/realyze/CanvaBoy/releases), unzip and drag it into the `Applications` folder.
2. Run `git config --global canvaboy.githubToken <Your GH API key>` to add your GitHub API key to your global git config (the token needs the "Repo" permission to be able to read your incoming PRs). You can generate the key [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Note: if you use [`git pr-train`](https://github.com/realyze/pr-train), CanvaBoy will use the token from the `.pr-train` file (so you don't need to do anything).
3. Ensure your token is authorised for the organisations you work in (such as Canva core org). You will need to do this again when regenerating after token expires.

4. Right-click the `CanvaBoy` icon in `Applications` and select `open` to start the app.

The application will automatically start when your computer starts (via [node-auto-launch](https://github.com/Teamwork/node-auto-launch)). (Unless you delete it, of course.)
